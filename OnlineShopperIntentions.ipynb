How were the data collected? What do the data describe? How many and which samples and features are there? Etc.**\n\n- The data was collected by tracking each session for an e-commerce website. Each sample is a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period. \n- In the study, the purchasing intention dataset is designed to measure the user’s intention to finalize the transaction (Revenue = TRUE or FALSE). Aiming to use the results to offer content only to those who intend to purchase and not to offer content to the other users.\n- 12,330 samples in the dataset, 84.5% (10,422) were negative class samples that did not end with shopping, and the rest (1908) were positive class samples ending with shopping.\n- 10 numerical and 8 categorical features\n    - Numerical Feature descriptions\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n        - **\"Administrative\"**, **\"Administrative Duration\"**, **\"Informational\"**, **\"Informational Duration\"**, **\"Product Related\"**, and **\"Product Related Duration\"** \n            represent the number of different types of pages visited by the visitor in that session and total time spent in each of these page categories\n            The values of these features are derived from the URL information of the pages visited by the user and updated in real time when a user takes an action, e.g. moving from one page to another. \n        - **\"Bounce Rate\"**, **\"Exit Rate\"** and **\"Page Value\"** \n            represent the metrics measured by \"Google Analytics\" for each page in the e-commerce site.\n            - **\"Bounce Rate\"** feature for a web page refers to the percentage of visitors who enter the site from that page and then leave (\"bounce\") without triggering any other requests to the analytics server during that session. \n            - **\"Exit Rate\"** feature for a specific web page is calculated as for all pageviews to the page, the percentage that were the last in the session. \n            - **\"Page Value\"** feature represents the average value for a web page that a user visited before completing an e-commerce transaction. \n            - **\"Special Day\"** feature indicates the closeness of the site visiting time to a specific special day (e.g. Mother’s Day, Valentine's Day) in which the sessions are more likely to be finalized with transaction. \n                The value of this attribute is determined by considering the dynamics of e-commerce such as the duration between the order date and delivery date. For example, for Valentina’s day, this value takes a nonzero value between February 2 and February 12, zero before and after this date unless it is close to another special day, and its maximum value of 1 on February 8. \n\n    \n\n\nThe dataset also includes operating system, browser, region, traffic type, visitor type as returning or new visitor, a Boolean value indicating whether the date of the visit is weekend, and month of the year.\n\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"26fcda1b-02d0-4b1c-a832-a763eaccd561"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Define the Problem
